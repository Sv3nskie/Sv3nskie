# Sven Esser - Web3, MERN stack and Unity Enthusiast.

Hello,

I'm Sv3n, a highly experienced full stack MERN developer and JavaScript enthusiast. I have a broad skill set, with expertise in many popular JS libraries like web3.js, D3js, jQuery, lightweight-charts, Google API and many more.

With years of experience in building web, iOS and Android applications, I specialize in creating high-quality, end-to-end solutions that are tailored to meet your specific needs. I work with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) and have extensive experience in building desktop applications with ElectronJS for Windows, macOS and Linux.

In addition to my proficiency in traditional web and app development, I also have a deep knowledge of web3 and Solidity EVM-based smart contracts. This allows me to deliver cutting-edge blockchain-based solutions that are both secure and efficient.

With a strong design background and an eye for detail, I'm dedicated to creating sleek and intuitive user interfaces that provide a seamless user experience. Whether you need a custom application for your business, a mobile app for your startup, or a blockchain-based solution for your enterprise, I have the skills and expertise to help you achieve your goals.
